Edit the component 
So we have some new type of nodes and relationships
So the already existing ones are ref nodes.
Now we will have 
ref - [belongs_to] -> uid
ref - [matches] -> ref
ref - [operated_by] -> operator
operator <- [belongs_to] - uid

only the matches will have the 13 instead of 12 props and others dont have any props
13 props :
face_score
left_index_score
left_little_score,
left_middle_score
left_ring_score
right_index_score
right_little_score
right_middle_score
right_ring_score
left_thumb_score
right_thumb_score
left_iris_score
right_iris_score

Now we have to make a filter pop menu where we can select following:
1. Which of these props to consider for degree calculation.
2. Threshold for each prop above which only the prop will be considered
3. Dont render the relationships which dont have a single prop to sstisfy above conditions

For degree calculation of each node:
ref => total "matches" relationships which are rendered
uid => total connected ref nodes with degree > 0
operator => total connected refs with degree > 0

Now the graph will render automatically when i apply the filters and then that filter pop menu will have a rerender button to render again according to new rules.

For the filter we can use an array of these 13 and their threshold set to zero by default and then the filter menu will have option to type threshold for each prop.
